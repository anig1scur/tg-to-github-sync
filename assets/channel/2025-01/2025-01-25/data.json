I ignore those who ignore me, and destroy those who offend me. Standing on the remaining heights of globalism, I forever look down upon and pity their narrow and closed-off souls.\n\nMeanwhile, more importantly, I create a spiritual homeland that can support me, ensuring that there I can be seen, heard, and engage in meaningful, deep conversations (for example: what works best for me is reading books, watching films, writing in my journal, and having dialogues with myself).","photos":[{"path":"618_20250125073704.jpg","width":1170,"height":1188,"id":618}],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":617,"created_at":"2025-01-25 11:53:04","date":"2025-01-25","text":"我 also 思 it's 天才。\n\n此 is 非常良 idea。","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":616,"created_at":"2025-01-25 01:46:47","date":"2025-01-25","text":"https://pudding.cool/2020/06/karen/\n\npudding.cool team is doing so meaningful work 😭️️️️️️","photos":[{"path":"616_20250124174647.jpg","width":1200,"height":628,"id":616}],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
