I've been thinking about key themes like Computer Graphics, Technical Artistry, Digital Media, and Creative Tools. Broadly, I want to pursue a field that blends technology and art to make a meaningful impact on people's daily lives.\n\nI understand that reaching my goals will require a significant commitment of time and energy to mastering math, research, coding, and debugging. But if this is the field I am passionate about dedicating my life to, why not start now? If I don't try, I'll regret and will try it one day eventually. If I try, even if I fail, at least Iâ€™ll know I gave it my all.\n\nThis is the perfect age to explore, to discover what truly matters to me. As Iâ€™ve decided, for the next two yearsâ€”and beyondâ€”letâ€™s just do it.","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
