After getting off, I was listening to \"到處留情\" through my headphones, reaching that incredibly beautiful violin part while walking from the bus stop to my apartment. Snowflakes were drifting in the air, and the surrounding lights were dim. A girl walked past me from the opposite direction, head down and wrapped tightly in her down jacket. Suddenly, a feeling of emotional nostalgia welled up inside me. But there's no one I want to share this with anymore, no one I can share this with anymore.","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":614,"created_at":"2025-01-23 10:51:26","date":"2025-01-23","text":"https://pudding.cool/2021/10/judge-my-music/\n\n这太好玩了!!","photos":[{"path":"613_20250123025126.jpg","width":1182,"height":1280,"id":613},{"path":"614_20250123025126.jpg","width":1260,"height":1214,"id":614}],"tags":["innovative","web"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":612,"created_at":"2025-01-22 15:02:56","date":"2025-01-22","text":">The era of chaos and turmoil has begun.\n\n>群魔乱舞的时代开始了。","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":611,"created_at":"2025-01-21 00:45:47","date":"2025-01-21","text":"Amazing and innovative project! \n\nhttps://pudding.cool/2024/10/abortion-mazes/","photos":[{"path":"611_20250120164547.jpg","width":1200,"height":628,"id":611}],"tags":["design","web"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":610,"created_at":"2025-01-20 10:20:52","date":"2025-01-20","text":"A life goal of mine is to visit the Galápagos Islands to see penguins—those adorable creatures that drift from Antarctica along the Peruvian Current to Ecuador.

Broadly, I want to pursue a field that blends technology and art to make a meaningful impact on people's daily lives.\n\nI understand that reaching my goals will require a significant commitment of time and energy to mastering math, research, coding, and debugging. But if this is the field I am passionate about dedicating my life to, why not start now? If I don't try, I'll regret and will try it one day eventually. If I try, even if I fail, at least I’ll know I gave it my all.\n\nThis is the perfect age to explore, to discover what truly matters to me. As I’ve decided, for the next two years—and beyond—let’s just do it.","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
