There’s no need to write separate CSS files, no hassle with props or state. useEffect and useState are almost handled implicitly for me, and there’s no unnecessary boilerplate code. Using stores is also super convenient. From now on, I’ve decided to use Svelte for all my new projects!\n\n前几天试着用 Svelte 写了一个小项目，感觉很不错。完全不用单独写 css 文件，没有 props/state 那么麻烦的玩儿意，useEffect 和 useState 几乎是隐式地帮我完成了，没有乱七八糟的模板代码，store 用起来也很爽。暂定之后的新项目一律使用 Svelte !","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
