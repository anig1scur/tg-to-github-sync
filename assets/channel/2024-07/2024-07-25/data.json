I realized that after breaking up, I no longer have emotional demands on him, and the state between us has become more relaxed. In the past, I used to spend a lot of time thinking about my relationship with another person, wondering why he said certain things, why he didn't consider me, why he didn't do things the way I wanted. \n\nI spent a great deal of time questioning and doubting others' love for me. But most men probably aren't naturally educated to be like this; they don't have attachment anxiety or survival anxiety. After the breakup, I found that I've become more independent and autonomous. I no longer timidly try to falsify or verify things. Perhaps this is the most precious thing I've learned from this relationship.","photos":[],"tags":["life","relationship"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
