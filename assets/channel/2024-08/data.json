The series  produced by Taiwan is a short series about legal defense, involving many elements like criminal justice, the death penalty, and foreign workers. These topics are deep and serious, which makes it hard for me to fully understand.\n\nThat's not the main point, though. The point is that we started to talk with our language exchange partner on Zoom after that. We talked about the Paris Olympics opening ceremony again, and I learned a lot about the metro system in Paris. Sometimes our language partner's speech was a bit fast or used some words that we were unfamiliar with. My friend and I put our heads in front of the screen and just said: \"Sorry, we're lost T^T\"\n\nYes, we really had an unsmooth conversation, but we tried to figure out the real meaning behind the words through body language, facial expressions, or by typing. I think this is the fun and touching part of language exchange — even though you don't know the language fully, you try to listen and understand each other","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":147,"created_at":"2024-08-02 13:27:54","date":"2024-08-02","text":"它提示说：请摘除口罩","photos":[{"path":"145_20240802052754.jpg","width":960,"height":1280,"id":145},{"path":"146_20240802052754.jpg","width":927,"height":1280,"id":146},{"path":"147_20240802052754.jpg","width":895,"height":1280,"id":147}],"tags":["Covid","PTSD"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":140,"created_at":"2024-08-02 11:20:49","date":"2024-08-02","text":"刚出单元门看到的景象，什么家庭啊这是！","photos":[{"path":"137_20240802032049.jpg","width":1280,"height":960,"id":137},{"path":"138_20240802032049.jpg","width":1280,"height":960,"id":138},{"path":"139_20240802032049.jpg","width":1280,"height":960,"id":139},{"path":"140_20240802032049.jpg","width":1280,"height":960,"id":140}],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":136,"created_at":"2024-08-01 20:15:00","date":"2024-08-01","text":"看了何同学的新视频，豆瓣怎么在里面又又又以负面影响出场了一次。","photos":[],"tags":["av"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":134,"created_at":"2024-08-01 19:27:11","date":"2024-08-01","text":"我最近给自己没事找事找的事也太多了，电量告急，累瘫在沙发上 \n_(:τ」∠)_ \n\n再坚持一段时间，今天还要给 tg sync 加个按月份筛选。周末睡个好觉！","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":133,"created_at":"2024-08-01 14:01:48","date":"2024-08-01","text":"有时间临摹一下这个风格！拿豆瓣 logo 来练手 🙊\n\nref: \n1. https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki\n2. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/650770214938056294/","photos":[{"path":"131_20240801060148.jpg","width":676,"height":671,"id":131},{"path":"132_20240801060148.jpg","width":636,"height":622,"id":132},{"path":"133_20240801060148.jpg","width":1169,"height":1157,"id":133}],"tags":["design"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":130,"created_at":"2024-08-01 12:56:42","date":"2024-08-01","text":"相信很多人都不知道的一个冷知识，ordered list formatting 超过 99 之后样式会 broken，需要一些额外的操作来正常展示。\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278202/markdown-enumerated-list-with-indices-over-99-changes-nested-list-formatting","photos":[{"path":"130_20240801045642.jpg","width":1050,"height":432,"id":130}],"tags":["TIL","trivia"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":129,"created_at":"2024-08-01 10:34:42","date":"2024-08-01","text":"悔不当初！我年少无知的时候怎么会在腾讯云那里买一个域名！ 现在加个子域名解析什么的都要用手机扫码，验证我的身份🔪🔪🔪","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
