I'm Eunice, a developer who is very interested in your relative-clip-path project. \n\nI'd like to express my appreciation for this tool - it's incredibly useful for handling CSS clip-path properties, and I personally love this project. I've noticed that the repository https://github.com/yoksel/relative-clip-path currently doesn't have an open-source license. \n\nI'm interested in packaging this functionality as an npm package to make it more accessible to other developers. However, before proceeding, I wanted to seek your permission. Would you be willing to add an open-source license to the repository? This would allow me to create an npm package based on your code while ensuring that you, as the original author, receive proper credit. If you agree, I'd be more than happy to acknowledge the original project and link to your GitHub repository in the npm package. \n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you! \n\nRegards, \nEunice","photos":[{"path":"231_20240830045933.jpg","width":1200,"height":600,"id":231}],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null},{"id":229,"created_at":"2024-08-30 01:29:13","date":"2024-08-30","text":"wowowowowowowo basically complete!","photos":[{"path":"229_20240829172913.MOV","width":-1,"height":-1,"id":229}],"tags":[],"quoted_message":{"id":228,"text":"我的天把这个做成自适应的好难呀 😭😭 好久没遇到这么难的难题了。 死磕 svg 是有道理的吗？ 为什么 png 不能 clipPath","from_id":"-1002204138509","created_at":"2024-08-30 00:49:36"},"forwarded_info":null},{"id":228,"created_at":"2024-08-30 00:49:36","date":"2024-08-30","text":"我的天把这个做成自适应的好难呀 😭😭 好久没遇到这么难的难题了。 死磕 svg 是有道理的吗？ 为什么 png 不能 clipPath","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":{"id":227,"text":"又有进步！","from_id":"-1002204138509","created_at":"2024-08-29 18:27:14"},"forwarded_info":null}]
