The series  produced by Taiwan is a short series about legal defense, involving many elements like criminal justice, the death penalty, and foreign workers. These topics are deep and serious, which makes it hard for me to fully understand.\n\nThat's not the main point, though. The point is that we started to talk with our language exchange partner on Zoom after that. We talked about the Paris Olympics opening ceremony again, and I learned a lot about the metro system in Paris. Sometimes our language partner's speech was a bit fast or used some words that we were unfamiliar with. My friend and I put our heads in front of the screen and just said: \"Sorry, we're lost T^T\"\n\nYes, we really had an unsmooth conversation, but we tried to figure out the real meaning behind the words through body language, facial expressions, or by typing. I think this is the fun and touching part of language exchange â€” even though you don't know the language fully, you try to listen and understand each other","photos":[],"tags":["life"],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
