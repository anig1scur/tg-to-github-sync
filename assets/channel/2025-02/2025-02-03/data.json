During my trip home for the Mid-Autumn Festival, I was forced to learn about my good-for-nothing brother's recent situation. I asked why they were still giving him money, enabling his downward spiral, saying that he would only understand when they completely stop supporting him. She said they couldn't give up on him, or he would truly abandon himself, adding that his low self-esteem has already led to depression. She then commented on how smart I am and how fortunate my fate is. She claimed that during her pregnancy with me, she coincidentally ate fish every day, which is why I'm good at studying, but she didn't know this when pregnant with my brother.\n\nHeaven knows I woke up at 6 AM and finished evening self-study at 10 PM in high school, studying under a desk lamp until midnight. Heaven knows how often I've been unhappy about not being smart enough and not developing my potential in childhood. Heaven knows how many times I've cried in endless self-doubt and internal struggle. My emotional breakdowns frequently affected my studies, and for a long time, I wished I had never been born.\n\nIf I seem fine now, it's because before age 21, everything I did was to prove that \"I'm absolutely not inferior to males\" and to spite those who insist on having sons. After 21, I felt I had already won this gender war at the family level, and now I focus more on self-realization and thinking about what I want to spend the rest of my life with. As for my brother, my poor brother, he's like a puddle of mud, spending endless hours watching Douyin videos, without thoughts, and of course —— without future.","photos":[],"tags":[],"quoted_message":null,"forwarded_info":null}]
